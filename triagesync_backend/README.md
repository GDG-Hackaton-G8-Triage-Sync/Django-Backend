4. Run server:
   python manage.py runserver

## Project Layout
- config: central Django configuration (settings, URLs, ASGI/WSGI)
- apps.authentication: user and auth flows
- apps.patients: patient submission flows
- apps.triage: triage analysis and validation services
- apps.realtime: websocket consumers and event broadcasting

# 🏗️ TEAM ASSIGNMENT APPROACHES

---

<div align="center">
  <h2 style="color:#1976d2; background:#e3f2fd; padding:10px; border-radius:8px;">🔷 1. MODULE-BASED APPROACH</h2>
</div>
---
## 1. Module-Based Approach
- Each team member owns a Django app/module (e.g., authentication, patients, triage, realtime, dashboard, core).
- Responsibilities are divided by technical boundaries (models, views, serializers, services, tests) within each module.
- Collaboration is required for cross-module features.
- **Pros:** Clear code ownership, easy onboarding for new members.
- **Cons:** Can create bottlenecks if features span multiple modules; less parallelism for feature delivery.

---

<div align="center">
  <h2 style="color:#388e3c; background:#e8f5e9; padding:10px; border-radius:8px;">🟢 2. FEATURE-BASED APPROACH</h2>
</div>
---
## 2. Feature-Based Approach
- Each member owns a feature slice (e.g., authentication, symptom submission, AI processing, triage logic, data management, real-time, dashboard, integration/testing).
- Responsibilities span across modules (models, services, views, serializers) for their feature.
- Collaboration is required for integration and shared logic.
- **Pros:** Parallel development, clear feature ownership, easier debugging.
- **Cons:** Requires strong communication to avoid code conflicts; onboarding can be more complex.

---

<div align="center">
  <h2 style="color:#f57c00; background:#fff3e0; padding:10px; border-radius:8px;">🟠 3. HYBRID APPROACH (RECOMMENDED)</h2>
</div>
---
## 3. Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- Combines module and feature-based strategies.
- Members are assigned to layers (Auth & Security, API, Service, Data, Real-Time, Integration) and also own features within those layers.
- Collaboration groups are defined for critical flows (Auth, AI, Data, Real-Time, Integration).
- Workload is balanced and responsibilities are clear.
- **Pros:** Maximizes parallelism, clear ownership, balanced workload, and strong collaboration.
- **Cons:** Requires good documentation and coordination.
